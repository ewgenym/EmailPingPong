beta:
+ (Small) Locate (but not open in a separate window) e-mail on double click in the conversation tree
+ (Small) Add Question\Asnwer buttons to the "Mail dialog", somewhere on the main ribbon
+ (Small) Order conversations by date in descending manner
+ (Big) Tree representation (make it look like in iOS\Android chat)

+ (Small) Add a button to ribbon that toggle conversation panel
+ (Big) Install package with new installer engine
+ (Medium) Add 'Close conversation' functionality (High priority)
+ (Medium) Add "Show\Hide conversation pane"

After beta release:
- (Small) Start using DB migrations
- (Medium) Use ConversationId generation logic like in native Outlook conversations as a fallback option for e-mail tracking. (The purpose is to make its optional to have EmailPingPong installed on both sides)
- (Big) When content controls are getting lost try restoring them from metadata attachment
- (Big) Tag the entire mail as the one conversation (like the native outlook conversation feature)
- (Medium) Security: consider generating password for database or prefrably use Windows Authentication if possible (Windows Authentication not supported in SQL CE).
- (Medium) Persist the selected settings, so user get them loaded when Outlook starts
- (Big) Stop here and make a technical improvements (see technical backlog)

vNext:
- (Big) Final answer (add a checkbox to each question, when user checks the box it means that last answer is final, show it somehow in the tree)



Technical backlog:
- Merge EmailPingPong.Outlook.Common and EmailPingPong.Outlook into one assembly
- sqllite (consider using it instead of SQL CE?)
- setup framework (InstallShield looks ugly)
-.net 4.5 + ef 6 (async operations)
- Single repository + specifications as extension methods
